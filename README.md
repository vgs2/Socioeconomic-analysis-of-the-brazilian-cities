Socioeconomic analysis of Brazil, its cities and states, checking the difference and similarities between all the brazilian regions, regarding economic measures, such as GDP, murder rate, population size and many other metrics from 2002 until 2017.  
This analysis was made using pandas, scikitlearn and Python Jupyter Notebook.
  
The murder rate (homicidios) dataset was found in the Atlas da Violência website  
(https://www.ipea.gov.br/atlasviolencia/filtros-series/1/homicidios)  
The population datasets (pop) were obtained through the IBGE website.
(https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/9103-estimativas-de-populacao.html?=&t=o-que-e)  
The gdp (pib) datasets were obtained through the SIDRA IBGE website.

Projects such as this one are only made possible bacause of the data collected by IBGE's CENSO (it is the most important governamental data collection event in Brazil), which was recently under threat by the lack of funding coming from the Brazilian Government.  
Thankfully, as of 20/05/2021 the CENSO is expected to happen, due to a Supreme Count ruling. Hopefully we will be able to get NEW and OPEN DATA pretty soon.
